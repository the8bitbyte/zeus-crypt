# zeus-crypt
zues-crypt is my open source encryption console app written is C# 

to download click "code" and click "download as zip" and run the .exe file

how to use:
to encrypt a file copy the file path (right click and click "copy as path") and paste it in once it asks for the unput file
when it asks for a output file paste the old file path but insted of the file extension replace it with .enc (it can be what ever you want but .enc is recomended)
its the same for decryption but the input is the path of encrypted file and the output is the path of the encrypted file but the .enc is replaced with the
old file extension
and all password are recomened to be over 5 letters or it could cause problems

this works on all files other then folders (i think)

warning: if you forget your password there is no getting your files back lol

also program.cs is not required to run the .exe file but i included it so its open source

if you are having trouble running it on windows 10 DM me (the8bit_byte10101) or if you have any feedback you can do [this](https://forms.gle/fVSKazuVCtA4TzFE7) form
